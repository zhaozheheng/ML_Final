CS6375 Final project: Prediction of Titanic Survivors

This project is aim to predict the survials of Titanic based on the Titanic surval
dataset with the information about every passenger. With some machine learning
models build in this project, the analysis of the machine learning models and the
comparison of the accuracy of the results are explored in this project.
