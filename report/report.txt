Dataset Description: 

  Data size: 891
  
  Attributes size: 12
  
  Attributes: 
  
•	Passenger ID: ID for every passenger.

•	Survived: Label for the survival (0 for not survival, and 1 for survived).

•	Pclass: The cabin class for every passenger, which is important for whether a passenger could survive eventually due to the safety facilities in different class.

•	Name: The name of every passenger.

•	Sex: Gender for every passenger, in our data describe, we had seen that the survival rate of females is higher than that of males. So it is an important attribute.

•	Age: Passenger’s age.

•	SibSp: Number of brothers and sisters for every passenger,

•	Parch: Number of parents and children for every passenger,

•	Ticket: ID of every ticket.

•	Fare: Price of tickets for every passenger.

•	Cabin: ID for different cabin.

•	Embarked: Port where a passenger boarded.

Data Preprocess: 

  Because the sklearn can only address number, we need to transfer the string-type values of every attribute to number-type like integer, float and so on.
  
  For the passenger ID attribute, it is just a index of data, so we did not care about it for training.
  
  For the name attribute, we thought it was a bit tricky to correlate it to the survival rate.
  
  For the sex attribute, it only has “male” and “female”, which we can treat it as a Boolean value. So we transfer “male” into “0”, while we transfer “female” into “1”.
  
  For the age attribute, there are only 714 values which means this attribute had N/A values. Because the number of N/A is not so large, we cannot treat it as noise. Then we choose to refill the N/A values by the median of the other 714 values.
  
  For the ticket attribute, we also thought it was a bit tricky to correlate it to the survival rate.
  
  For the cabin attribute, it has lots of N/A value, so we treat it as noise and remove this from our training.
  
  For the Embarked attribute, it has 3 string values “S”, “C” and “Q”, but it has some N/A values. So by describing the data we found that the count of “S” is largest, and then we use “S” to refill the N/A values. After that we transfer “S”, “C”, “Q” into “0”, “1”, “2”.
  
  After finishing data preprocess, we refined the data to 1 label and 7 attributes. (“Survived” as label, while “Pclass”, “Sex”, “Age”, “SibSp”, “Parch”, “Fare” and “Embarked” as attributes.)
